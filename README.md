# blelt2mqtt : Bluetooth LE LT Thermometer 2 MQTT

This software is a simple gateway to publish on MQTT for use with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) or [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com/) temperature
data from cheap bluetooth LT Thermometer sensors.

## Supported devices

Currently, protocol versions 3 and 4 are supported. Other versions might be supported as well, as there seems to be
little to no changes in between 3 and 4.

**Note for V3 users:**  
It is very likely V3 users will experience a battery drain issue which seems to be fixed in V4 devices. This is the 
main reason the workarounds in **blelt2mqtt** attempting to resolve this issue have been removed. Please feel 
free to file an issue in case you are using a V3 device and experiencing the battery drain mentioned.

These devices are supported by an android application named "qaqa" which is, among other place, available here:

## Installation

Prerequisites:
* Linux, Windows or MacOS (only tested on Linux / Raspberry Pi and Windows 11)
* Bluetooth LE compatible device (with installed stack)
* Python3 with pip3

**blelt2mqtt** can be installed and ran in multiple ways. Two of those methods are explained below. The first being
a simple daemon running as your current user. The second, preferred way, as a systemd service running as a dedicated
system user.

### Method 1: User daemon
Installation steps:  
#### 1. **Optional**: Create a virtual environment (venv)  

Debian users will need to install `python-venv` first if not installed! Python will warn you about that.

First, create a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create the venv
python3 -m venv .venv
# Activate the venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To be sure, let's first upgrade PIP in our fresh venv:
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### 2. Install needed Python modules (bleak, paho-mqtt)

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Configure your sensor and MQTT server in the configuration file
Please take a moment to review and set up the configuration. Your devices and (optional) MQTT broker setup is done here.

**blelt2mqtt** comes with a default (example) configuration file `config-default.yaml`. Although you can edit this 
file directly, it is recommended to copy it to `config.yaml` and make your changes there.
**blelt2mqtt** will first look for `config.yaml` and, in case that fails, load `config-default.yaml` as a last resort.

#### 4. To ensure the software is launched at startup :

```
crontab -e

@reboot bash /path/to/blelt.sh
```

### Method 2: System service
#### 1. Create system user
First, let's create a dedicated system user with a home directory. The home directory will be user for by example
caching and log files.
```bash
# Add dedicated system user and group with home (for caching etc)
sudo useradd -rm blelt2mqtt
```

#### 2. Create directory and set permissions
```bash
# Create directory and set permissions
sudo mkdir /opt/blelt2mqtt
sudo chown blelt2mqtt:blelt2mqtt /opt/blelt2mqtt
```

#### 3. Download blelt2mqtt
Either download the latest release of blelt2mqtt in your preferred way or clone the git repository:
```bash
cd /opt/blelt2mqtt
git clone https://github.com/rpeyron/blelt2mqtt.git .
```

#### 4. Setup venv and requirements
##### 4.1 Switch to our dedicated user, create a venv and activate it
```bash
# Switch to dedicated user
sudo -u blelt2mqtt -H -s
# Create venv
cd /opt/blelt2mqtt
python -m venv .venv
# Activate venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
##### 4.2 Upgrade pip
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
##### 4.3 Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 5. Configure blelt2mqtt
Please take a moment to review and set up the configuration. Your devices and (optional) MQTT broker setup is done here.

**blelt2mqtt** comes with a default (example) configuration file `config-default.yaml`. Although you can edit this 
file directly, it is recommended to copy it to `config.yaml` and make your changes there.
**blelt2mqtt** will first look for `config.yaml` and, in case that fails, load `config-default.yaml` as a last resort.

#### 6. Install and start service
An example, ready-to-use service file is bundled with blelt2mqtt and located in the installation directory. In case you 
diverged from the given path by, for example, changing paths, please edit `blelt2mqtt.service` before continuing.

```bash
# Copy the service file
sudo cp /opt/blelt2mqtt/blelt2mqtt.service /etc/systemd/system
# Reload services
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# Start the blelt2mqtt service
sudo systemctl start blelt2mqtt.service
```

In case you want the service to always be enabled, for example after a reboot, simply enable the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable blelt2mqtt.service
```

## Configure Domoticz / Home Assistant

This should not require extra configuration for use with MQTT auto-discovery.

### Domoticz

If you want to have a domoticz sensor with temperature and humidity, you need to follow these steps:
1. Configure a virtual sensor Temperature+Humidity through the Dummy hardware in Hardware menu
2. Read the idx of the created device in the Devices menu
3. Add the idx in the configuration file as 'domoticz_idx'

You should now see the sensor (native sensor on the left, auto-discovered on the right) :
![Example of sensor in domoticz](docs/assets/domoticz.png)

### Home Assistant

By default, the auto-discovered device is a MQTT device with the components **temperature**, **humidity** 
and **battery**.  

#### Extracting attributes as entities

In case you want to extract data from the attributes as separate entities (and possibly manipulate the extracted data)
follow the steps below. This gives an example of manipulating the temperature entity and creating a separate humidity 
entity.

1. Open _configuration.yaml_
2. Add the following. Replace <DEVICE.NAME> with your device's bluetooth name.  
```
# blelt2mqtt sensor example
mqtt:
  - sensor:
    - name: "My Area - Temperature"
      state_topic: "lt_temp/<DEVICE.NAME>>/state"
      suggested_display_precision: 1
      unit_of_measurement: "°C"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.temperature }}"
    - name: "My Area - Humidity"
      state_topic: "lt_temp/<DEVICE.NAME>/state"
      unit_of_measurement: "%"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.humidity }}"
```
3. Check the configuration and reload Home Assistant.

#### Using sensor cards
1. Edit dashboard
2. Add to dashboard > by card
3. Choose **Sensor**
4. Configure the sensor data you want to display as desired.



## Protocol

The reverse-engineered protocol is described in [protocol.md](docs/protocol.md) and the process is described in this [article (in french)](https://www.lprp.fr/2022/07/capteur-bluetooth-le-temperature-dans-domoticz-par-reverse-engineering-et-mqtt-auto-discovery-domoticz-et-home-assistant/)
